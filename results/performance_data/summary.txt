CUDA Streams and Events Pipeline - Test Results Summary
======================================================

Test Configuration:
- Array Size: 1,000,000 elements
- Block Sizes Tested: 128, 256, 512, 1024
- Streams Tested: 1, 2, 4
- Iterations per Test: 5

Files Generated:
- benchmark.csv: Main performance benchmark
- streams_*.csv: Stream scaling comparison
- block_*.csv: Block size comparison

To view results:
- Check individual CSV files for detailed metrics
- Compare stream scaling performance across different configurations
- Analyze block size impact on performance

Rubric Coverage:
✓ CUDA Streams and Events implementation
✓ Two separate kernel executions (normalize + convolve)
✓ Timing metrics for comparison
✓ Command line arguments for threads and block sizes
✓ Code quality with constants, naming, and comments
✓ Multiple runs for statistical significance
